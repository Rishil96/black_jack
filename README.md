# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022

# Day 11
# Project Name - Black Jack

This program is the computer version of the Black Jack game where a player can play against the computer/dealer.
Initially both the player and the dealer draw two cards. The main goal is to reach as close as possible to the 
number 21. 
After the initial draw of cards the player will be given an option to either draw another card or stick with the current 
cards. If the sum of the cards exceeds 21 then the player loses till then he/she can draw as many cards as they wish to 
reach closer to 21.
After the player decides to stick with his hand and has not crossed the total of 21, the dealer will start drawing cards.
The dealer is forced to draw if his hand total is less than 18. If his hand total crosses 18 the dealer will stop drawing cards.
The one closer to 21 wins and if both the dealer and player's total are equal then the round is a tie.
After each round if the player wants to play again, he can type yes to play again and a new round of Black Jack will begin.
